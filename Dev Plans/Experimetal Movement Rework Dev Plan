~ EXPERIMENTAL MOVEMENT REWORK ~

Inputs & Mechanics:
  W - Accelerate forward
  S - Brake / Pace backwards
  A - Strafe left
  D - Strafe right
  Space - Jump / Double jump? / Glide??
  Left Alt - 180
  Left Shift - Scale: x2
  Left Ctrl - Scale: x0.5

  Horizontal wall-running: Run alongside a wall with enough speed and jump, aiming slightly towards the wall, but mostly still in the direction of desired travel. Travel further than just jumping.
  Vertical wall-running: Run directly at a wall with enough speed and jump, stepping up the wall a few times and gaining some height.
  Grabbing ledges: Can shimmy left and right, pull self up, or jump backwards, gaining a little height. Can only look 270 degrees.
  Grabbing bars and poles: Poles on (90 degree only?) corners can be grabbed to swing round that corner really fast. Can grab horizontal bars to hang and swing and jump from.
  Slide down slants of 45 degrees or more. Go faster than top running speed.
  Height damage?

DONE - Basic player prefab
  DONE - Capsule collider body
  DONE - Camera
  DONE - Scale up check trigger collider
    DONE - Trigger controller
  DONE - Grounded check trigger collider
    DONE - Trigger controller
DONE - Mouse looking
  BUG: X-axis rotation clamping at just -88 to 0
    CAUSE: transform.localEulerAngles is not the same as the local rotation shown in the inspector. Above 0 degrees, the X rotation goes to 360 degrees and down.
    FIX: If localEulerAngles.x > 180 then minus 360.
PROGRESS - Basic movement
  DONE - Set up Input axes
  DONE - Movement intent: where the player is trying to move
    DONE - MovementIntent rework
  DONE - Move forward
  DONE - Brake
  DONE - Move backwards
  DONE - Strafe
  BUG: player moves slightly when standing still
  PROGRESS - Jump
    DONE - Basic force change
    DONE - Change jump direction based on speed
    DONE - Smooth jump
    BUG: Pressing jump in mid-air makes you jump again when you hit the ground
    Hold jump for bigger arc
    Tweak
DONE - Rework camera to avoid jittering
