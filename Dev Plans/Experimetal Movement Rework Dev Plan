  Horizontal Wall-Running: Run alongside a wall with enough speed and jump, aiming slightly towards the wall, but mostly still in the direction of desired travel. Travel further than just jumping.
  Vertical Wall-Running: Run directly at a wall with enough speed and jump, stepping up the wall a few times and gaining some height.
  Grabbing Ledges: Can shimmy left and right, pull self up, or jump backwards, gaining a little height. Can only look 270 degrees.
  Grabbing Bars and Poles: Poles on (90 degree only?) corners can be grabbed to swing round that corner really fast. Can grab horizontal bars to hang and swing and jump from.
  Slide down slants of 45 degrees or more. Go faster than top running speed.
