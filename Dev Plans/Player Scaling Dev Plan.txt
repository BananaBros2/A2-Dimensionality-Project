~ PLAYER SCALING ~

Inputs: Left Shift, Left Ctrl

DONE - Set up player scaling axis in input manager
PROGRESS - Implement basic scaling mechanic
  DONE - Changing scale based on Input
  DONE - Implement maximum scale range
  DONE - Implement scale up check
    BUG: Can't scale up with scale trigger implemented
      CAUSE: Scale up trigger making contact with ground collider
      FIX: Adjusted trigger size and position
    BUG: Scale up check not functioning
      CAUSE: Scale up trigger was checking for tag not layer
      FIX: Changed trigger if statements to check layer
  Scale other values that should scale with size
    Work out what those values are
Implement FOV change
Implement feedback for not being able to scale
  either by max scale range
  or no room to scale up
Implement smoother scaling
